# @berenjena/react-dev-panel

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   a3eb29d: # Automatic Control Persistence

    Added built-in persistence functionality to React Dev Panel controls. Controls can now automatically save and restore their values across page reloads using localStorage.

    ## New Features

    -   **`persist` property**: Add `persist: true` to any control to enable automatic persistence
    -   **`controlPersistenceService`**: New service for manual persistence control
    -   **`getInitialValue` helper**: Utility function for initializing state with persisted values
    -   **Automatic cleanup**: Persisted values are automatically cleaned up when components unmount

    ## Breaking Changes

    None - this is a fully backward-compatible addition.

    ## Documentation

    -   Added comprehensive persistence guide (`guides/PERSISTENCE.md`)
    -   Updated all control documentation with persistence examples
    -   Enhanced advanced usage guide with persistence patterns
    -   Updated README with persistence feature overview

    This enhancement improves developer experience by eliminating the need for manual localStorage implementation while providing fine-grained control over which values should persist.
